title: Query arbitrary shapes

## Basic Concepts

Although Jimmer entities are strongly typed, they are also dynamic and can express the ever-changing shape of data structures. 

Therefore, Jimmer supports `ObjectFetcher`, which can control the shape of the queried data structure and then uniformly return Jimmer entities. 

:::tip This is an extremely similar concept to GraphQL, but there are huge differences:

-   GraphQL is an application layer protocol based on HTTP that can only expose this capability by building HTTP services, and only HTTP clients can enjoy this capability. 

-   For Jimmer, the ability to query arbitrary shapes is an inherent behavior of ORM that can be used programmed anywhere.

    -   You can use it to expose [GraphQL services](../../graphql).

    -   As shown in the content of this section, you can also expose REST services.
    
    -   It can even be used within applications without crossing any remote boundaries.

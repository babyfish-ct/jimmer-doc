Jimmer focuses only on the ORM itself and does not provide auxiliary tools, such as generating entity interface definitions based on the database structure.

Enthusiastic people have contributed related tools, welcome everyone to actively contribute related tools, and submit PRs for me to include them in the list. As of now, the collected projects are:

## Precompilation Experience Optimization

**Project Type:** Intellij Plugin

**Project Address:** [https://github.com/Enaium/JimmerBuddy](https://github.com/Enaium/JimmerBuddy)

**Feature Description:** When entity interfaces or DTO files change, there is no need to explicitly compile or run the project. The code is automatically regenerated, improving the development experience.

## DTO Language Syntax Highlighting Support

| IDE | Project Address |
| --- | --- |
| Intellij Plugin | [https://github.com/ClearPlume/jimmer-dto](https://github.com/ClearPlume/jimmer-dto) |
| Any IDE supporting LSP | [https://github.com/Enaium/jimmer-dto-lsp](https://github.com/Enaium/jimmer-dto-lsp) |

:::caution
The two plugins perform the same function and should not be installed simultaneously in Intellij, as this will cause errors.

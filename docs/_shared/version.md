Please replace ·TODO: latest.version· in the code below with the really version number. 

Please refer to https://github.com/babyfish-ct/jimmer/releases, find the latest release from there, remove the leading `v`, and the rest part is the really version number.
For example, if the last release on this page is `v0.9.64`, then the actual version number is `0.9.64`.

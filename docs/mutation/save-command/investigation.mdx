## Concepts

In daily project development, there is a very challenging issue: translating database constraint violation errors into user-friendly error messages.

Based on constraints that cannot be simply validated through input validation, databases have three types of constraints that are difficult to handle when violated:

-   Primary key constraints
-   Unique constraints *(or unique indexes)*
-   Foreign key constraints

To standardize across different database products, the SQL standard specifies that errors caused by constraint violations have the category code [23 *(integrity constraint violation)*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQLSTATE). All related error states begin with `23`.

However, standardization ends there. For more detailed issues, such as:

-   Which constraint was violated

-   How to get the table name and column name from the database dictionary based on the constraint name

-   Most importantly, which data row modification action caused the exception

Different database products behave inconsistently and lack clear APIs to obtain this information.

To provide users with clear error descriptions, many business projects adopt a simple but crude method: <ViewMore buttonText="pre-checking through queries" size="small"><Precheck/></ViewMore> to determine if the upcoming operation is safe before execution.

However, this pre-checking approach has many disadvantages:

-   Developers need to write various pre-checking code repeatedly, leading to high development costs

-   Only suitable for simple single-record DML modifications, completely unsuitable for advanced operations like save commands that recursively save deep data structures in batch

-   Poor performance, as errors are rare events, and pre-checking every time is wasteful

Therefore, Jimmer adopts the following strategy:

-   Uses post-investigation approach, directly modifying the database first, and if constraint violation errors are reported, investigating the cause afterward

-   During error investigation, uses queries to gather as much information as possible, reporting:

    -   The path of the illegal object in the saved data structure

    -   The entity type and related properties that caused the error

    -   The specific object and related data that caused the error

-   Allows users to customize exception translators to further translate Jimmer's investigated exceptions into end-user friendly messages

:::info
The database error investigation can occur due to either root object save failure or associated object save failure. Jimmer treats both cases equally, without distinction.

However, to simplify the documentation, the examples in this article demonstrate saving relatively simple objects, avoiding deep data structures *(in fact, if saving deep associated objects fails, it will be investigated the same way)*.

## Checking for Id Conflicts

    })

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

This code will generate the following two SQL statements:

1.  Batch insert data

    1.  ```sql

    Here, inserting the second record will cause an `id` conflict

2.  Investigate the cause of the constraint violation

        tb_1_.ID = any(? /* [100, 7] */)
    ```

    </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

    -   Scenario 1
        
        The row violated the constraint can be located by the `java.sql.BatchUpdateException` thrown by batch operation, 
        so only the error row needs to be investigatd

    -   Scenario 2
        
        The row violated the constraint can not be located by the `java.sql.BatchUpdateException` thrown by batch operation, 
        so all rows need to be investigatd

        > Postgres and MySQL with batch capabilities enabled (see [MySQL Issues](./mysql)) both fall into this scenario

    Either way, Jimmer can investigate and identify the problem.

Finally, Jimmer will throw an exception based on the investigation results:

```sh
#highlight-next-line
org.babyfish.jimmer.sql.exception.SaveException$NotUnique: 
    Save error caused by the path: "<root>": 
    Cannot save the entity, the value of the id property

In the [Mapping/Advanced Mapping/Key](../../mapping/advanced/key) article, we introduced that entities can be configured with multiple unique constraints *(or unique indexes)* *(in fact, this documentation has not been modified yet)*.

If an entity has more than one unique constraint *(or unique index)*, Jimmer will investigate them one by one.

I'll translate the document while maintaining the technical terms as requested.

# Checking the Existence of Associated Objects

In save commands, associations are divided into [long associations and short associations](./association/classification.mdx).

- For long associations, if the associated object doesn't exist, Jimmer will automatically create it first, so there is no issue of non-existent associated objects.

- For short associations, Jimmer assumes that the associated object must exist, and problems will arise if the associated object doesn't exist.

Therefore, this issue is specific to short associations. In the following examples, all associated objects are id-only objects.

In [Mapping/Basic Mapping/Real and Fake Foreign Keys](../../mapping/base/foreignkey), we introduced that Jimmer supports both real and fake foreign keys.
Only real foreign keys involve database constraint violation issues, so we'll discuss them separately.

### Fake Foreign Keys

For fake foreign keys, there are no foreign key constraints in the database. If the specified associated object doesn't exist, meaning the association ID is invalid, the database has no opinion on this.

Therefore, by default, Jimmer doesn't check whether the associated object exists for fake foreign keys, allowing users to save invalid dangling values.

Although this is unrelated to the main topic of this article, we'll still explain it. Users can configure the save command to make Jimmer verify the existence of associated objects beforehand.

:::info

        }),

        .setMode(SaveMode.UPDATE_ONLY)
        // highlight-next-line
        .setAutoIdOnlyTargetChecking(
                BookProps.STORE
        )

    // highlight-next-line
    setAutoIdOnlyTargetChecking(
        Book::store
    )
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Here, the `setAutoIdOnlyTargetChecking` method is used to set which short associations need to be verified beforehand.

Before saving the data, Jimmer will verify the association IDs through a query

```sql
select
    tb_1_.ID
from BOOK_STORE tb_1_
where
    -- highlight-next-line
    tb_1_.ID = any(? /* [2, 999] */)
```

Finally, it throws the following exception

```sh
#highlight-next-line
org.babyfish.jimmer.sql.exception.SaveException$IllegalTargetId: 
    Save error caused by the path: "<root>.store": 
    Cannot save the entity, the associated id of the reference 
    property "com.yourcompany.yourproject.model.Book.store" is 
    #highlight-next-line
    "999" but there is no corresponding associated object in the database
```

### Real Foreign Keys

For real foreign keys, there are foreign key constraints in the database. If the specified associated object doesn't exist, meaning the association ID is invalid, the database will report a constraint violation error.

Without any user configuration, if an error occurs, Jimmer will automatically analyze the error reported by the database to identify the invalid association ID.

## User Exception Translator

### Exception Translation Interface

As mentioned earlier, Jimmer investigates database-reported constraint violations and throws exceptions

-   `org.babyfish.jimmer.sql.exception.SaveException.NotUnique`

    Violation of primary key constraint, unique constraint, or unique index

-   `org.babyfish.jimmer.sql.exception.SaveException.IllegalTargetId`

    Illegal association ID

These two exceptions not only provide detailed error messages but also offer rich APIs to obtain various information.

However, this is far from enough. In real projects, we must display easy-to-understand information for end users.

Indeed, we can catch and handle exceptions after each save command call. However, Jimmer supports more powerful unified exception translation.

Jimmer provides an exception translation interface `ExceptionTranslator`, the code is as follows

```java title="ExceptionTranslator.java"
package org.babyfish.jimmer.sql.runtime;

public interface ExceptionTranslator<E extends Exception> {

    /**
     * Translate the exception.
     *
     * <p>If the exception is not known how to be translated,
     * return null or the original argument.</p>
     */
    @Nullable
    Exception translate(@NotNull E exception, @NotNull Args args);

    interface Args {
        ...omitted...
    }
}
```

Users can implement this interface through classes *(note: lambda expressions cannot be used)* and specify generic type parameter for the interface, for example:

-   Translate `SaveException.NotUnique` exception

    <TabItem value="java" label="Java">

    ```java
    public class NotUniqueExceptionTranslator
    extends ExceptionTranslator<

        ...omitted...
    }
    ```

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

        SaveException.NotUnique
    > {
        ...omitted...
    }
    ```

    </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

        ...omitted...
    }
    ```

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

        SaveException.IllegalTargetId
    > {
        ...omitted...
    }
    ```

    </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

-   You can even translate other JDBC exceptions that Jimmer is not interested in

### Multiple Registration Methods

Just writing a class to implement this interface is useless; you must create an object and register it to Jimmer take effect.

Jimmer provides two registration methods, taking the `NotUniqueExceptionTranslator` mentioned above as an example:

1.  Global registration, which can be divided into two types

    1.  Not using Jimmer's spring starter

        <Tabs groupId="language">
        <TabItem value="java" label="Java">

        ```java
        JSqlClient sqlClient = JSqlClient
            .newBuilder()
            // highlight-next-line
            .addExceptionTranslator(
                new NotUniqueExceptionTranslator()
            )
            ...other configurations omitted...
            .build();
        ```

        </TabItem>
        <TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

        ```kotlin
        val sqlClient = sqlClient {
            // highlight-next-line
            addExceptionTranslator(
                NotUniqueExceptionTranslator()
            )
            ...other configurations omitted...
        }
        ```

        </TabItem>
        </Tabs>

    2.  Using Jimmer's spring starter

        <Tabs groupId="language">
        <TabItem value="java" label="Java">

        ```java
        // highlight-next-line
        @Component
        public class NotUniqueExceptionTranslator
        extends ExceptionTranslator<SaveException.NotUnique> {
            ...omitted...
        }
        ```

        </TabItem>
        <TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

        ```kotlin
        // highlight-next-line
        @Component
        class NotUniqueExceptionTranslator :
        ExceptionTranslator<SaveException.NotUnique> {
            ...omitted...
        }
        ```

        </TabItem>
        </Tabs>

2.  Register for specific save commands

    <Tabs groupId="language">
    <TabItem value="java" label="Java">

    ```java
    Book book = ...omitted...;

    sqlClient
        .saveCommand(book)
        // highlight-next-line
        .addExceptionTranslator(
            new NotUniqueExceptionTranslator()
        )
        .execute()
    ```

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

    ```kotlin

    sqlClient.save(book) {
        // highlight-next-line
        addExceptionTranslator(
            new NotUniqueExceptionTranslator()
        )
    }
    ```

    </TabItem>

### Implementing the `translate` Method

Finally, let's show how to implement the `translate` method

-   Translate `SaveException.NotUnique` exception

    <Tabs groupId="language">
    <TabItem value="java" label="Java">

    ```java
    @Component
    public class NotUniqueExceptionTranslator
    extends ExceptionTranslator<SaveException.NotUnique> {
        
        @Override
        public @Nullable Exception translate(
            @NotNull SaveException.NotUnique exception, 
            @NotNull Args args
        ) {
            
            // highlight-next-line
            if (exception.isMatched(BookProps.ID)) {
                return new IllegalArgumentException(
                        "Book with ID " +
                                exception.getValue(BookProps.ID) +
                                " already exists"
                );
            }
            
            // highlight-next-line
            if (exception.isMatched(BookProps.NAME, BookProps.EDITION)) {
                return new IllegalArgumentException(

                                exception.getValue(BookProps.NAME) +
                                " and edition " +
                                exception.getValue(BookProps.EDITION) +
                                " already exists"
                );
            }
            
            //No processing needed, can also be written as `return exception`
            return null;
        }
    }
    ```

    <TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

                    )
                else ->
                    null //No processing needed, can also be written as `exception`
            }
